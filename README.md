# Veracross-Student-Extension
A Chrome extension for the students who use Veracross.
The extension can automatically reload the Veracross page, check the grades' updates, and notify the users. It can calculate the GPA, but I get the data from my high school website, so it may not be correct in other schools.
I only test the extension on my account, so if you find any bugs, please contact me.

### What can the extension do
1. Check the grades' updates automatically
2. Notify the change of grades
3. Calculate and show the GPA
4. Analyze grades in detail for each class
