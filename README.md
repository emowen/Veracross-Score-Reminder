# Veracross-Student-Extension
A Chrome extension for the students who use Veracross.
The extension can automatically reload the Veracross page, check the grades' updates, and notify the users.
It can calculate the GPA, but I get the data from my high school website, so it may not be correct in other schools.
I only test the extension on my account, so if you find any bugs, please contact me.

### What can the extension do
1. Check the grades' updates automatically
2. Notify the change of grades
3. Calculate and show the GPA
